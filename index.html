    <h1>Control Flow - Growing Pains</h1>

    <h2>Part 1: Growing Pains</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        Your task is to create a program that advises a group of environmental scientists how to handle the growth and spread of a unique plant species under their supervision. 
        <br>
        You must develop a growth control system that will monitor and predict the plant growth, making decisions based on the available space and potential growth.
        <br />
        <br />

       <h3>Here is the information you have been given:</h3>
        <br />
        <li>
            The area in which the plants are contained is circular, with a radius of 5 meters. 
        <br>
            (The formula for calculating the area of a circle is PI multiplied by the radius, squared:const PI = 3.1415;const area = PI *     radius * radius;)
        </li>
        <br>
    
        <li>Each plant requires a minimum space of 0.8 square meters.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The area is starting with 20 plants.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The plants double in number every week.</li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Using this information, your objectives are to:</h3>
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Predict the plant growth after a specific number of weeks.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Implement control flow to make decisions on whether the plants should be:
        </li>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Pruned, to stop them from exceeding the capacity of the garden. 
                <br>
                (This condition should be met if the plant count after the given number of weeks is greater than 80% of the maximum capacity of the garden).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Monitored, if they are growing at an acceptable rate. 
                <br>
                (This condition should be met if the plant count is between 50% and 80% of the maximum capacity of the garden after the given number of weeks).
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                Planted, if there is room to plant more plants. This condition should be met if the plant count after the given number of weeks is less than 50% of the maximum capacity of the garden. Within your submission, include the results for 1, 2, and 3 weeks of growth as inputs.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h2>Part 2: Thinking Bigger</h2>

    <p>
        The conservation area in which the garden is located has multiple other
        gardens. 
        <br>
        
    <h3>Using the logic you have already created, determine:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The amount of additional space that would be required if the scientists were to start with 100 plants, and did not prune them for 10 weeks. </li>
            <br>
            <li>If the space remained circular, what would be the radius of this expanded garden?</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Part 3: Errors in Judgement</h2>

    <p>
        The scientists decided not to listen to your recommendations, and have instead started with 100 plants in the original 5-meter-radius garden. 
        <br>
        <li>Use "try and catch" to wrap your work in an error-handling block.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li>If the amount of space required to hold the originally provided number of plants exceeds the amount of space available, throw a new error and log an appropriate message.</li>
    </p>
